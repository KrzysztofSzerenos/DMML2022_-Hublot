# DATA MINING AND MACHINE LEARNING - PROJECT 2022 GROUP : HUBLOT
## PROJECT GOAL 
Create a Machine Learning model that predicts the level of French
## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project proceeds in the form of a competition. Each team has to create a Machine Learning model that predicts the level of the french language on a scale from A1 to C2 as accurate as possible. The trained model has to be submitted to Kaggle competition. Published under this link: shorturl.at/fhMQS. In addition, at the very beginning we were asked to examine the **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-score** of the following models below:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **kNN**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forests**
- **Any other technique (of our choice)**

**All the results received are based on the TRAIN (80%) TEST (20%) split.**
## DATA DESCRIPTION
### Files:
- **training_data.csv** : training set 
- **unlabelled_test_data.csv** : the test set
- **sample_submission.csv** : a sample submission file in the correct format
### Training_data.csv description:
#### Columns:
- **id:** training set 
- **sentence:** the test set
- **difficulty:** a sample submission file in the correct format
## PROJECT WORK STAGES
**After checking all the moodels without any improvements, we decided that we would like to focus on the Naive Bayes model because it gaves us the second highest accuracy and we found a lot of information that this model is often use for Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
